## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/28/5):

>1. Add a Done button as a navigation bar item that causes the app to re-lock immediately rather than waiting for the user to quit. This should only be shown when the app is unlocked.
>2. Create a password system for your app so that the Touch ID/Face ID fallback is more useful. You'll need to use an alert controller with a text field like we did in project 5, and I suggest you save the password in the keychain!
>3. Go back to [project 10](https://github.com/gurman-man/100-days-of-swift/tree/main/Projects/28-SecretSwift/Project10(authentication)) and add biometric authentication so the userâ€™s pictures are shown only when they have unlocked the app. Youâ€™ll need to give some thought to how you can hide the pictures â€“ perhaps leave the array empty until they are authenticated?
