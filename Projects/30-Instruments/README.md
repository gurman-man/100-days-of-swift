[Project 30](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/30/overview) from the [100 Days of Swift course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) by [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).

>An interactive UIKit app that displays a gallery of rounded images and tracks tap counts using UserDefaults. The project also explores performance optimization with Time Profiler and Allocations Instruments, practicing image caching, rendering, and smooth animations.

## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/30/7/wrap-up):

>1. Go through project 30 and remove all the force unwraps. Note: implicitly unwrapped optionals are not the same thing as force unwraps â€“ youâ€™re welcome to fix the implicitly unwrapped optionals too, but thatâ€™s a bonus task.
>2. Pick any of the previous 29 projects that interests you, and try exploring it using the Allocations instrument. Can you find any objects that are persistent when they should have been destroyed?
>3. For a tougher challenge, take the image generation code out of `cellForRowAt:` generate all images when the app first launches, and use those smaller versions instead. For bonus points, combine the `getDocumentsDirectory()` method I introduced in project 10 so that you save the resulting cache to make sure it never happens again.
