## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/2/6/wrap-up):

>1. Try showing the player's score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
>2. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score.
>3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message ‚Äì something like ‚ÄúWrong! That‚Äôs the flag of France,‚Äù for example.
