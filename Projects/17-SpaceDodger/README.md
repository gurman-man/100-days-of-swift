## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/17/5):

>1. Stop the player from cheating by lifting their finger and tapping elsewhere â€“ try implementing touchesEnded() to make it work.
>2. Make the timer start at one second, but then after 20 enemies have been made subtract 0.1 seconds from it so itâ€™s triggered every 0.9 seconds. After making 20 more, subtract another 0.1, and so on. Note: you should call invalidate() on gameTimer before giving it a new value, otherwise you end up with multiple timers.
>3. Stop creating space debris after the player has died.

## To Do as a Personal Challenge...

- Add Game Over sprite 
- Add lives
- Add **Try again** button when showing **Game Over**
