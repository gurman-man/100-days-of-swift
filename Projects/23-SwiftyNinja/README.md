## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/23/8):

>1. Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.
>2. Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
>3. Add a ‚ÄúGame over‚Äù sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.

## To Do as a Personal Challenge...

- To add **New Game** button
