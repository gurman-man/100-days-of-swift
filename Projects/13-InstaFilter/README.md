## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/13/5):

>1. Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
>2. Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
>3. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.

## To Do as a Personal Challenge...

- [ ] To add more filters
