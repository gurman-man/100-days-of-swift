## Challenge Instructions

*Instructions taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/6/3).*

>Your challenge is to make an app that contains facts about countries: show a list of country names in a table view, then when one is tapped bring in a new screen that contains its capital city, size, population, currency, and any other facts that interest you. The type of facts you include is down to you ‚Äì Wikipedia has a huge selection to choose from.
>
>To make this app, I would recommend you blend parts of project 1 project 7. That means showing the country names in a table view, then showing the detailed information in a second table view.
>
>How you load data into the app is going to be an interesting problem for you to solve. I suggested project 7 above because a sensible approach would be to create a JSON file with your facts in, then load that in using `contentsOf` and parse it using `Codable`. Regardless of how you end up solving this, I suggest you don‚Äôt just hard-code it into the app ‚Äì i.e., typing all the facts manually into your Swift code. You‚Äôre better than that!
>
> Go ahead and try coding it now. If you hit problems, here are some hints:
>
>- You should create a custom `Country` struct that has properties for each of the facts you have in your JSON file. You can then have a `[Country]` array in your view controller.
>- When using a table view in your detail view controller, try setting the `numberOfLines` property of the cell‚Äôs text label to be 0. That ought to allow the cell to fill up to two lines of text by default.
>- Don‚Äôt forget all the little UI touches: adding a disclosure indicator to the countries table, adding titles to the navigation controller, and so on. You could even add an action button to the detail view that shares a fact about the selected country.
